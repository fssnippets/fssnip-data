// In this snippet I use a class instance as a reusable factory which
// removes trivial function implementation.
// It seems that OOP class features eliminated boilerplates from the FP code.
// And this OOP class is easily implemented by using FP features.
// It's an interesting result isn't it?
// (I know there are already many examples that shows the multi-paradimn language really shine)
