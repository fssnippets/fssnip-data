// From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure
// In computing, a disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track 
// of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (nonoverlapping) 
// subsets. A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful 
// operations on such a data structure:

// Find: Determine which set a particular element is in. Also useful for 
//       determining if two elements are in the same set.
// Union: Combine or merge two sets into a single set.

// Implementation from: http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/AlgsDS07/01UnionFind.pdf

/// Quick-find... Union is O(N), Flat Trees
/// Quick-union... Trees are tall, Find is O(N), Find requires union
/// Overall: O(MN) -- M union-find ops on a set of N objects
